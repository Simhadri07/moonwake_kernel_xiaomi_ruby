## Compile guide

### Option 1: Compile and go (This way to compile my kernel directly from my source)

1. Fork [kernel-build-from-rainyland/builder-non-gki](https://github.com/kernel-build-from-rainyland/builder-non-gki) repo
2. Enable action build in Actions tab
3. Click on `Build Kernel`
4. Click on `Run workflow`
5. With `Choose a config type` option, choose it as `package`
6. With `Path to a specific config JSON file (optional). Leave blank to use all configs.`, type `xiaomi-ruby.json`
7. Click `Run workflow` green button and wait
8. Download, extract the build and flash!

If you don't know how to flash, [click here](https://t.me/rainy_land_releases/56) (skip step 1 because you already have anykernel build and you know how to push it into your phone)

### Option 2: Kernel Player (For advanced user that build android kernel before)

Since you (Kernel Player) know how to build, pack AK3 and flash it, I just have some notes for you
- Compile it with only google `clang-r530567 (19)`, `clang-r498229b (17.0.4)` or `clang-r487747c (17.0.2)`. Clang 18, 20, 21 or older have some issues with ln8000 driver with make CN and IN variant can't boot
- This source use BBR3 by default, it's works well, but if you don't want BBR3, please disable it in `arch/arm64/configs/ruby_defconfig`
- To add KSU config, please use `make $your_args_here kernelsu.config` after using `make $your_args_here ruby_defconfig`
- Recommended using `-O2` only, `-Ofast` and `-O3` will cause some stability problems

- Wireguard may have some issues or unused, you can disable it in `arch/arm64/configs/ruby_defconfig`
